# SVG generator

## Description
    The SVG generator takes user input from inquirer package and asks user for text, text-color, shape (either triangle, circle, or square), and shape-color, then dynamically generates an svg file with thoe specifications. That file consitiutes the code for a business logo.

## Usage
    Launch the index.js using node, i.e., "node index.js", in the command line. You will then be prompted with questions to answer as mentioned in the description section of this README.md file. If done correctly, the terminal will log "logo.svg generated", and the file will appear. You can launch the file in the browser to view your logo.
